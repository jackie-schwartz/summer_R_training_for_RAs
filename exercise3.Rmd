Directions: Import the Titanic dataset (from R datasets package) 
*Briefly* describe it in words   
(e.g., how many variables, observations, what the variables mean)
Make summary table first describing people who survived vs. not survived.  
Make second summary table describing people who survived by sex and age.   
Make a third summary table describing people who survived by class.
Graph the distribution of Freq by suvivial, age, sex, and class   
(have fun with this part - can do multiple graphs.   
I want to see the progression of structure in the data).

Install these libraries first

```{r}

```
There was a good question about the contents of "glimpse."  
It's not like head which shows the first 5/6 rows.  
It shows all the variables.

# Summary Table 1:  
Make summary table first describing people who survived vs. not survived.  
```{r}
sum_table1 <-
  titanic %>%
  group_by(Survived) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Freq),
    sd = sd(Freq),
    n = n()
  )
print(sum_table1)
```

# Summary Table 2:  
Make second summary table describing people who survived by sex and age.
```{r}
sum_table2 <-
  titanic %>%
  group_by(Survived, Sex, Age) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Freq),
    sd = sd(Freq),
    n = n()
  )
print(sum_table2)
```

# Sumary Table 3:  
Make a third summary table describing people who survived by class.
```{r}
sum_table3 <-
  titanic %>%
  group_by(Survived, Class) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Freq),
    sd = sd(Freq),

  )
print(sum_table3)
```


REMEMBER WITH HISTOGRAMS YOU ARE ONLY FILLING IN THE X AXIS. THE Y AXIS  
IS "COUNT", NOT ANY EXISTING VARIABLE FROM YOUR DATAFRAME.

## Error Bars and CI bars: What do they mean?

__CI__
A confidence interval provides an estimated range for a   
population parameter based on the sample mean, not the level   
of confidence (usually 95%), and standard error.   

A 95% confidence interval for a range of scores is
constructed such that the population parameter
will fall within this range in 95% of samples.  
![95% CI.](/Users/jsschwartz/Dropbox/Stanford_Affective_Science/28b_SummerRtutorial/2019/95percCI.jpeg)
This website does a really good job explaining it: http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/BS704_Confidence_Intervals/BS704_Confidence_Intervals_print.html  

Remember: When we compute a statistic on a sample, it will have some  
amount of error (compared to the true population parameter).  
The amount of error varies from sample to sample. The distribution of sample  
statistics, across different amounts of error, is called the  
sampling distribution.  
We use a confidence interval to express the precision and uncertainty
associated with a particular sampling method. With a 95% confidence interval,   
if we take 100 samples from a population, we expect 5 of the  
intervals not to contain the true mean. 

__How to calculate CI:__
SEM = stand dev/sqrt(n)
What is SEM? stand error of the mean
CI(95%) = mean Â± 1.96 * SEM

If you are comparing groups, and the  SEM bars overlap, there  
is no statistical difference between the groups. If they do not overlap, you  
can be pretty sure that there is a statistical difference. 
That means the groups distributions look like this:  

![Difference Between Groups in terms of Distributions.](/Users/jsschwartz/Dropbox/Stanford_Affective_Science/28b_SummerRtutorial/2019/diffbtwngrps.png)
CI bars are different from SEM bars.The same rules about overlapping bars  
do not apply here. We like using CI bars more often then SEM bars because  
CI bars don't assume that your sampling distirbution is normal.  
With CI bars you are asking how reliable is your point estimate. 

What is that 1.96?  
It's the t critical value (determined by df and alpha).. 
If your t-stat (formula below) lies above the critical value, you can say  
that your effect  does not lie within the null distribution.   
So you reject the null.

![Calculating t-stat.](/Users/jsschwartz/Dropbox/Stanford_Affective_Science/28b_SummerRtutorial/2019/tstat.png)


![Calculating 2 sample t-stat.](/Users/jsschwartz/Dropbox/Stanford_Affective_Science/28b_SummerRtutorial/2019/2sampttest.png)
denominator is the pooled variance. So if your SEM is small,   
your t-statistic is...?    

# AN EXMAPLE:  
```{r}
airquality <-
  airquality %>%
  mutate(
    Month_rec =
      recode_factor(Month,
        "5" = "May",
        "6" = "June",
        "7" = "July",
        "8" = "August",
        "9" = "September")
  )
```

```{r}
sdtemp <- sd(airquality$Temp)
num_obs <- length(airquality$Temp)

qt(.05/2, df = 30) * (sdtemp/sqrt(n))


mean_and_ci <-
  airquality %>% 
  group_by(Month_rec) %>% 
  summarise(num_obs = n(),
            mean_temp = mean(Temp),
            ci_lower =
              mean_temp - qt(0.975, df = num_obs-1) * sd(Temp)/sqrt(num_obs),
            ci_upper =
              mean_temp + qt(0.975, df = num_obs-1) * sd(Temp)/sqrt(num_obs)
            )
mean_and_ci
```

__YOUR TURN__  
I would approach this problem in R by starting with   
a __bar plot__ where the height of the bar maps to the mean   
of each group and the length of the error bars map   
to the width of the confidence interval. 


```{r}
g1 <-
  mean_and_ci %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = Month_rec, y = mean_temp)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(
    ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper)
    ) 
print(g1)
```

> Ok, let's discuss! What do we like? What do we not like?   
> And how would you change it? 

Let's try to improve our information to ink ratio by   
changing the bars to points and removing the horizontal   
lines from the confidence interval. 

```{r}
g2 <-
  mean_and_ci %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x=Month_rec, y = mean_temp)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(
    ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper)
    ) 
```

> This looks a little cleaner,   
> but how could we make it even more informative? What's missing?

If we wanted to communicate information about the distribution,   
summary statistics, and confidence intervals, the   
__boxplot__ is a pretty useful tool.They are sooo underused, but I think  
incredibly informative.

```{r}
May <- airquality[which(airquality$Month_rec == "May"),]
May_mean <- mean(May$Temp)

Sept <-
  airquality[
    which(airquality$Month_rec == "September"),
    ]
Sept_mean <- mean(Sept$Temp)

mean_and_ci <- 
  mean_and_ci %>% 
  mutate(
    Temp = mean_temp
    )

g3 <-
  airquality %>%
  ggplot(., 
         aes(x = Month_rec,
             y = Temp)
         ) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3) +
  ylim(50, 100) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = May_mean,
    linetype = "dashed",
    color = "pink") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = Sept_mean,
    linetype = "dashed",
    color = "black") +
  annotate(geom = "text", 
    x = 0.65,
    y = 63, 
    label = "65.5 \n degrees in May", 
    color = "pink") +
  annotate(geom = "text",
    x = 0.65,
    y = 74, 
    label = "76.9 \n degrees", 
    color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Month",
       y = "Avg. Temperature (degrees Farenheit)"
       ) 
```
__Pointers__
A boxplot splits the data set into quartiles.   
The body of the boxplot consists of a "box" (hence, the name),   
which goes from the first quartile (Q1) to the third quartile (Q3). 

Within the box, a horizontal line is drawn at the Q2,   
the median of the data set, and two vertical lines,   
called whiskers, extend from the top and bottom of the box.   
The bottom whisker goes from Q1 to the smallest non-outlier   
in the data set, and the top whisker goes   
from Q3 to the largest non-outlier.

You can also see whether there is skew in the data.  
If most of the observations are concentrated  
on the low end of the scale, the distribution   
is skewed right; and vice versa.   
If a distribution is symmetric, the observations   
will be evenly split at the median,  
as shown above in the middle figure.

__YOUR TURN__  
Let's practice interpreting the box plot  
above by answering the following questions:   

* What's the median for each group?   
* The Range?   
* The Interquartile Range (IQR)  
* Is there evidence of skew in any of the groups?   

> See how the mean line for May is slighlty below the median,   
and for September, the mean line is slightly above the median.... 
When the mean is greater than the median,   
the distribution is skewed to the right  
(the "tail" stretches towards the right-positive skew!   
there is a long tail in the positive direction of the number line).   
The sd is a measure of variability (or spread) of the distribution.

But, notice that we lost some information from the previous plot that would help us with visual inference (drawing conclusions about whether the population means are different from one another) -- the confidence intervals.

> How could we put that information back on the plot?

                      ymax = ci_upper),

                  data = mean_and_ci) +
